# The Thing

*“I didn’t believe the rumors. Why would I? Just another 'ghost story' to spook the new recruits. But then I saw it… The Thing…”*

*“At first, it was just a shadow—nothing more than a flicker at the edge of my vision. I shrugged it off, focused on the objective. But then, I felt it watching. Not like when you sense someone staring at you. No, this was different... heavier.”*

*“It’s patient, you know. It waits… letting you think it’s gone. But every time you move, every turn, it’s still there. Closer. Watching.”*

*“By the time I realized what was happening, it was too late. I was alone, all the others gone. And then, there it was—right in front of me.”*

*“Next thing I knew, I was dragged, swallowed up by darkness, no matter how hard I fought. I ended up in that room. You know the one—the one no one wants to talk about.”*

*“It was waiting for me, setting the rules… the game. It knew I’d play. It knew I’d try to survive. It watched me the whole time, from the dark corners, as I struggled to escape.”*

*“I barely made it out… but I don’t think I’m really free. Because no matter where I go, I still feel it watching. And I know… I’ll have to play again.”*


## Monster behavior

<details>
<summary>Spoiler behavior</summary>

The Thing is a creature that lurks in the darkness, observing players quietly and strategically. It doesn’t rush its prey; instead, it follows them subtly, keeping itself hidden and waiting for the right moment. Each time it appears, it’s only a fleeting glimpse—a shadow slipping out of sight, just enough to be noticed and trigger a sense of dread.

The creature has a unique pattern: it watches multiple players, as if it’s studying them, but it only acts after observing a specific number. Once it has its eyes set, The Thing abducts the last player it saw. It doesn’t simply chase them; instead, it pulls them suddenly into a dark, ominous room.

In this room, the abducted player is trapped and must play a game to escape. The rules of this game are unknown at first, and the player has no choice but to play to survive. The Thing watches them the entire time from the shadows, observing each struggle and mistake. If they manage to escape, The Thing releases them, but it leaves a lasting feeling of being watched, as if it may one day return for another game.
